# Multithreading-mini projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects focusing on the basics of multithreading, executed in python. Each mini-project explores different multithreading aspects and a practical application.

## What is Multithreading?

Multithreading is a programming concept where multiple threads within a process execute independently to perform tasks concurrently. It enables programs to utilize various processors efficiently, running tasks to run in parallel and thus, improves the overall performance of the system.

## Projects Overview

### Mini-Project-1: Create multiple files using threading

In this mini-project, used multithreading to create multiple files concurrently. With threads, you can speed up file creation processes, especially when dealing with large volumes of files.

### Mini-Project-2: Convert multiple files to upper case

Multithreading can be utilized to convert multiple text files to uppercase simultaneously. This project demonstrates the parallel processing capability of threads to enhance the efficiency of file manipulation tasks.

### Mini-Project-3: Convert multiple images to grayscale

Employing multithreading for image processing tasks. This mini-project focuses on converting multiple images to grayscale using concurrent threads, demonstrating how multithreading can accelerate image transformation operations.

### Mini-Project-4: Convert multiple videos to grayscale

Extending the previous idea by applying it to video processing. This project demonstrates how to convert multiple videos to grayscale concurrently, showcasing the performance benefits of using threads for multimedia processing tasks.
